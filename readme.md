# Random Colors

This is a project i made to train basic skills with plain Javascript by using Array methods and other interesting stuff to manipulate the DOM.
I also improved knowledge about colors and how they work.

## Single Color

In this page you can randomly change background color, copy it, save it for later and remove it.

## Gradient

In this page you can randomly get a 2 colors linear-gradient background.
You can change degrees to have a different slope and eventually copy the generated css code.

## New Feeatures

I'm working on new features to add. :)
