# Random Colors

This project represents a hands-on learning experience with plain JavaScript, encompassing a range of key topics in web development. Throughout the project, I focused on mastering essential concepts, such as responsiveness using Flexbox, DOM manipulation through event listeners for window resize events, dynamic updating of containers, array methods, Local Storage usage, Math functions, and hexadecimal color representation.

By delving into these topics, I gained a deeper understanding of building responsive layouts using Flexbox, ensuring that elements adapt gracefully to various screen sizes. Additionally, I learned how to utilize event listeners to detect window resizing and dynamically adjust container layouts, providing a smoother user experience.

The project also involved honing my skills in handling arrays through various methods. I practiced transforming and manipulating array data, which is a foundational skill in web development.

Moreover, I explored the usage of Local Storage, a client-side web storage feature, to store and retrieve data persistently within the browser. This allowed me to create a seamless user experience, with saved data available even after page refreshes.

To enhance my grasp of JavaScript, I dived into using various Math functions, understanding their purpose, and applying them appropriately in my code.

Furthermore, I deepened my knowledge of colors and their representation using hexadecimal codes. By working with colors in my project, I gained practical insights into color theory and color handling in web design.

Overall, this project provided me with valuable hands-on experience, and I am now equipped with essential skills in front-end development, enabling me to create more interactive and responsive web applications.



## Single Color

In this page you can randomly change background color and get the corresponding hex code by copying it. 
You can also save it for later and remove it to make space for other colors.
Colors are saved in local storage.

## Gradient

In this page you can randomly get a 2 colors linear-gradient background.
You can change degrees to have a different slope and eventually copy the generated css code.

## New Features

I'm working on new features to add. :)
